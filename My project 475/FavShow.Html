                    <h4><center><Strong>Forensic Files</Strong></center></h4>
                  <p>Forensic Files is by far my favorite show. It is my favortie because it features alot of crime cases that have gone cold and then have been solved using forensic science. The show interviews many people who were related to a particular case. Some of these people could be eye witnesses, police officers, loved ones of the victim, or in some rare cases the criminal himself.I personally love the fact that forensic files is a reality Tv show. It puts into perspective the accounts of everyone involved in a single case.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Alot of the cases feature many instances of someone breaking into a persons house and leaving them murdered without a tangible trace. This is when forensic science comes into play. With forensic science, prosecutors are able to collect evidence that might not be visible to the naked eye like DNA left behind by the perpatrator. In an episode there was one case where DNA was found under the finger nails of the victim. This is common when victims fight back at their attackers. Scientists are able to swab the victims finger nails and extract DNA via a cotton swab. This show puts into perspective just how much the advancement of technology and science has helped law enforcement solve many cold cases. </p>
